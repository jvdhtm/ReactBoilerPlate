            Pages are specific instances of templates. Here, placeholder content
            is replaced with real representative content to give an accurate
            depiction of what a user will ultimately see.

        <p>
            Pages are the highest level of fidelity and because they’re the most
            tangible, it’s typically where most people in the process spend most
            of their time and what most reviews revolve around. The page stage is
            essential as it’s where we test the effectiveness of the design
            system. Viewing everything in context allows us to loop back to modify
            our molecules, organisms, and templates to better address the real
            context of the design. Pages are also the place to test variations in
            templates. For example, you might want to articulate what a headline
            containing 40 characters looks like, but also demonstrate what 340
            characters looks like. What does it look like when a user has one item
            in their shopping cart versus 10 items with a discount code applied?
            Again, these specific instances influence how we loop back through and
            construct our system.
